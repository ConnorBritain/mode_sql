# SQL Learning Journey with Mode's Courses

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through Mode's "Learn SQL" and "Analyst Certificate Path" courses. As a cloud engineer, I've embarked on this path to deepen my SQL skills and apply them to real-world data analysis challenges that I may face in various production environments.

## What's Inside

- **Basic SQL Concepts**: Understanding the foundation of SQL including SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT, and more.
- **Intermediate Skills**: Diving into aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, and advanced querying techniques.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Exploring complex topics like data types, performance tuning, and window functions.
- **Real-World Applications**: Applying SQL skills to solve actual business scenarios and data analytics problems.
- **Labs and Projects**: Hands-on labs and projects that I've completed throughout the course.

## Goals

My primary aim is to:

1. Master SQL from basic to advanced levels.
2. Apply SQL knowledge in practical, real-world analytics scenarios.
3. Share my learning and project outcomes with the community.

## Progress

I'll be updating this repository regularly with notes, lab solutions, and insights as I progress through the courses.

## Connect with Me

I'm open to collaborations and discussions. Feel free to reach out if you're on a similar learning path or have insights to share!
